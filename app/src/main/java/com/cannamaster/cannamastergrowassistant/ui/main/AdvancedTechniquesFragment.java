The plants will be identical down to their DNA.  Find out how to clone your prettiest girls.",
                "One of the great things about cannabis is the ease in which it clones.  A clone is an exact genetic copy of the parent plant. By using clones you can guarantee your plants are always female as well as perfect your care regimen to suit a particular plant.  Since each clone is an exact genetic copy, you will see absolute consistency between grows.\n" +

                        "When a shoot from a plant grows roots this new plant is considered a clone.  So when we are taking clones all we are really trying to do is force the plant to grow roots.  This is a survival mechanism ingrained in many plants.  If a plant were to be broken in half in the wild by a rock slide for example, by being able to grow roots, the plant can survive even after a tragic natural event to hopefully pass on its genetics to the next year.\n" +

                        "Clones are created using supple new shoots from the parent plant.  These fresh shoots are called ‘cuts’ before they grow roots and become ‘clones’.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Roots like to develop in the dark.  If you have a choice make sure the part of the cut you are trying to root is not in the direct light and avoid all light to the rooting area if at all possible.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "The cut must be kept moist at all times.  Until the new cut gets roots of its own it will have to get its moisture from your rooting medium and natural humidity.  Fresh cuts are not forgiving and once left to dry out, it is a matter of hours before they are no longer alive.  Forgetting to replace a humidity dome or waiting an extra day to water could be the quick death of your potential clones.\n" +

                        "Clones will often look horrible right before they sprout roots.  Yellowing clones is not a bad sign.  It is the cut gathering all its stored energy out of the leaves and using it to create a new root system.\n" +

                        "The ability for the plant to produce all female seeds is actually a survival mechanism.  Producing all female seeds gives the plant its best chance at passing on its genetics which is at the heart of any cannabis plant.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "It only takes one male to pollinate an entire field of cannabis, so by producing all female children the plant species puts on its best effort for prolonging its tenure on earth.  Males can pollinate plants within 2 miles of themselves, so it just makes sense that producing all female children is the best option to prolong the life of the species.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "So how does all this really work?  It all comes down to hermaphrodites.  Any female cannabis plant can be forced to produce male sex organs.  This is done through either stress, the use of colloidal silver, or simply letting an unpollinated cannabis plant continue to flower well past its ripe point.  The plant will randomly shoot out bannana looking appendages.  These male organs are bright yellow and contain thousands upon thousands of pollen particles each.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "These ‘nanners’ manifest right from the flowering buds and sometimes they cluster together at node intersections resembling grape bunches.  These tiny green grape like balls eventually swell and burst open with groups of male ‘nanners’ that look very similar to how bananas are grouped when purchased from the store.  It really depends on what method you use to induce the male ‘nanners’ as to how they will appear.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Forcing male parts from female plants turns the plant into a hermaphrodite.  As these methods of stressing the female to play both sexes can introduce the hermaphrodite gene into your genetic pool.  It is said that 70% of all natural landrace cannabis carries a genetic hermaphrodite gene that can show up unwanted at any point during flower.  This surprise transformation will cause your seedless crop to become riddled with seeds if not noticed and dealt with immediately.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "The hermaphrodite ‘nanners’ contain pollen which when introduced to a female pistol will start to produce a seed.  This developing seed is guaranteed a female.  No males can be produced this way.  In order to get a male plant you need to have pollen from a natural male mix with a true female plant.  When a male and female plant procreate they do not produce all male seeds, it should be roughly a 50/50 mix of male and female seeds but you will have no way of telling them apart short of actually growing them out.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "The hermaphrodite gene is dominant and virtually impossible to breed out once it has a foothold in your genetic pool.  For this reason it is recommended that breeding be done with pure male and pure female plants.  This method of breeding allows for the best chance of solid and stable genetics down the line.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Seeds don’t make your crop less potent but most certainly affect the taste, bag appeal, and production of buds.  Once a plant starts to produce seeds it transfers all its energy into making seeds and backs off on its resin and bud production.  A plant pollinated early in flower will produce substantially less cannabis than a plant that finishes its entire lifecycle unpollinated under the same conditions.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Fem seeds are a great option for outdoor growers and with proper testing of fem seedstock one can assure solid indoor plants as well.  It is much harder to stress a plant outdoors under the natural sun and climate.  This stress cushion often allows cannabis plants with the hermaphrodite gene to finish completely without exhibiting the hermaphrodite traits.  This does not mean that the gene is not present. Moving the same strain or even clones indoors can manifest the male parts to start appearing without warning.  You aren’t Mother Nature and you can’t take care of your girls as well as she can.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Many breeders do not test their seed stock well enough and flood the market with hermaphrodite prone genetics.  The best way to avoid getting caught in this loop is to use trusted and established breeders with solid track records of producing hardy and uniform seedstock.  Using regular seeds and pheno hunting may be the best option for finding a good mother plant if the hermaphrodite threat worries you.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "To review. Female plants pollinated by hermaphrodite pollen (females that throw male parts) can only produce feminized seeds.  Male seeds can only be produced if a natural male provides the pollen but this does not guarantee all the children will be male.  \n", "36",

                "The _id does not really purvey the simplicity of this method of concentrate extraction.  Rosin tech is the practice of heating up individual nugs with a woman's flat iron while sandwiched in between several layer of parchment paper.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "The process is quite simple although the yield is not very large.  You will have to press several nugs to get a small one person DAB but the quality and cleanliness of the final product is unmatched by any other method currently available.  There is no butane or CO2 needed which eliminates the risk of an explosion which is a very real threat when creating dabs with other methods.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Other methods involve either high pressure systems when using supercritical CO2 to extract your dabs or highly volatile butane gas when extracting under traditional methods.  With rosin tech there is also no need to ‘cook’ your dabs in a vacuum oven as there are no foreign bodies in the DAB extract when using the rosin tech method.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Remember you can only get out what you put in, meaning that the better quality of the starting material the better your extracted DABs will be.  You can use ditch weed and expect to get dispensary quality shatter.  Although if you use a high quality starting material you can create dabs that are as good or even better than what you can find at a local dispensary.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "The process is actually quite simple.  All you need to make your own personal rosin tech DABs is a flat iron (some may call this a hair straightener), some fresh (preferably sticky) nugs and some quality parchment paper.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Start by folding the parchment paper in half several times until you get a folded square 1-2 layers thick.  You will be placing a nug inside the parchment paper similar to how you fill a taco.  The nug will be sandwiched between the parchment paper and covered completely.  If the nug is not covered completely your DABs may run off the paper onto your hot iron and vaporize on the flat iron before you get a chance to enjoy your hard earned work.\n" +

                        "Once you have sandwiched the nug in between your folded parchment square you will apply the flat iron to the exterior of the folded parchment applying direct pressure while being careful not to start burning the parchment paper itself.  There is a sweet spot you are trying to hit with respect to both ideal temperature and length of your press.\n" +

                        "Higher quality flat irons allow you to set the maximum temperature with a digital dial or an analog knob.  These higher quality flat irons are recommended if you plan on making any substantial amount of DABs using the rosin tech method.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "The ideal temperature for rosin tech is between 280F-300F.  You want to press the nug and parchment firmly with the flat iron for roughly 5-6 seconds or until you see the ‘puff of smoke’ emanate from your parchment.  This puff will be substantial and continuing to leave your parchment in the flat irons grasp will result in burning your material or even igniting the parchment paper itself.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Once you have pressed your nug with the flat iron, proceed to opening the paper and you should see small drops of what looks like honey sticking to the paper.  This honey looking goo is your DAB.  You will need to use a small tool to collect and consolidate all the resin from the parchment paper.  This tool can be almost anything from a paper clip to a custom made titanium dab tool or anything inbetween.\n" +

                        "That’s it.  Once you consolidate all your presses you should have a substantial DAB or DABs for personal use.  You aren’t going to be making mountains of shatter using rosin tech but you can keep yourself in dabs for very little cost compared to traditional methods that require purchase of butane, CO2, propane, and/or other various tools.  Rosin tech only requires the purchase of parchment paper once you have the flat iron.  This is a very cost effective option, especially if you are only trying to keep your head straight.\n" +

                        "The spent nugs do however make great compost if you are using an organic cultivation method.  The THC might have been extracted but the micro nutrients and embedded elements are still present just waiting to be broken down and fed to your growing ladies.
